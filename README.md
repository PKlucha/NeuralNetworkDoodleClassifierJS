### Data used in this case is from [Google Quick Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data).

You can also go [Here](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com) to contribute to the database!
Your drawing is stored every time Google's AI guesses what you draw.

## To run this you have to install node.js, express and socket.io modules.
